#  Project Overview
Interest rates have a significant effect on the economy, influencing consumer spending and manufacturing rates. Mortgage rates comprise a significant cost for housing buyers; a 4% increase in a 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate, from 3% to 7%, adds $280,740.62 to the cost of a $400,000 mortgage. Accurate mortgage rate forecasts are valuable for investors, firms, government entities, and homebuyers. The models and techniques from this study could potentially provide accurate mortgage rate forecasts and trends for 2024 and beyond. We analyzed performance of different models including times series and regression in forecasting the interest rates into future and made recommendations at the end.
